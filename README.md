Project Overview

This project is a clone of the GamifyCat website, designed to showcase my web development skills and understanding of modern web technologies. I've focused on replicating the original website's key features, including its visually appealing design, interactive elements, and seamless user experience.

- HTML5: For structuring the content and layout.
- CSS3: For styling the elements and creating the visual design.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic behavior.
- Intersection Observer API: For optimizing performance by triggering animations only when elements are visible.
